## üìù Recommendations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ For Real-Time Critical Systems

- **Recommended:** FixedPriority arbiter
- **Rationale:** Accepts fairness trade-off for guaranteed QoS
- **Caution:** Monitor best-effort starvation and adjust if needed

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ For Balanced QoS + Fairness

- **Recommended:** DynamicPriority arbiter
- **Rationale:** Good middle ground for mixed workloads
- **Benefit:** Adapts to changing traffic conditions

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ For Fairness-Critical Systems

- **Recommended:** WeightedRoundRobin arbiter
- **Rationale:** Configure weights based on traffic class priorities
- **Caution:** Accept slightly higher latency for better fairness

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid in Production

- **Not Recommended:** Random arbiter
- **Reason:** No QoS guarantees, poor fairness
- **Use Case:** Only useful for testing or non-critical applications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Starvation Analysis

### Starvation by Traffic Class (averaged across all tests)

- **Real-Time:** 70.3% (target: near 0%)
- **Isochronous:** 95.0%
- **Best-Effort:** 96.9%

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Real-time starvation detected! Critical issue for QoS systems.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Excessive best-effort starvation. Consider load balancing.
